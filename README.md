Download or clone this repository and copy its contents over to your web folder

## Configuration
Open `api/config.php`.
```php
<?php
$dbUser = "<DB USER>";
$dbPass = "<DB PASS>";
$dbName = "<DB Name>";
$coinHiveSecret="<Secret>";
```
Replace the placeholders with your database credentials.  
The next step is to fill in your '$coinHiveSecret'.  
To find it log in to your coinhive account and click `Setting` on the top right corner then click `Sites & API Keys` and copy your `Secret Key (private)` and replace `<Secret>` with it.

The last step is to configure your sitekey.  
Open `scripts/miner.js` and replace the key in this line
```js
var siteKey = "IQHaechLpoNlho4NmXatRn4iPyQEhDmP"; //Change to your address
```
with your `Site Key (public)`.
